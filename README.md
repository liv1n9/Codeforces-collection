  <li>Choose the collecting mode. There are also three modes for you:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>All</strong>: You will get all your accepted submissions. If you got more than one accepted submission of one problem, for example 2 accepted C++ submissions of problem 265C, you will get 2 file 265c_1.cpp, 265c_2.cpp. Otherwise you will get only one file, for example 265c.cpp.</li>
      <li><strong>Time</strong>: For each problem, you will get an accepted submission which has fastest running time.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory</strong>: For each problem, you will get an accepted submission which has smallest memory used.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Now press "Get" and enjoy!</p>
